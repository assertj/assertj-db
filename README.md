AssertJ-DB - Assertions for database
==========

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.assertj/assertj-db/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.assertj/assertj-db)

AssertJ-DB provides assertions to test values in a database.

The goal is to be an alternative to DBUnit for people who don't like to write XML.

You can find all the information you need in the [documentation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-db).
