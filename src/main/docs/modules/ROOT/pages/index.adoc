AssertJ-DB provides assertions to test data in a database.
It requires Java 8 or later and can be used with either JUnit or TestNG.

If you need additional assertions, please create a ticket in the https://github.com/assertj/assertj-db/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open[AssertJ-DB issue tracker].

AssertJ-DB is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/assertj/assertj-db[https://github.com/assertj/assertj-db].

Big thanks to Joel Costigliola for his welcome, for his help and for having accepted to associate this project with a great project like AssertJ.
