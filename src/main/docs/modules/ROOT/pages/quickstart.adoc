= Quick start

Suppose that the database contains this table *MEMBERS* :

|===
|ID |NAME |FIRSTNAME |SURNAME |BIRTHDATE |SIZE

|1 |'Hewson' |'Paul David' |'Bono' |05-10-60 |1.75
|2 |'Evans' |'David Howell' |'The Edge' |08-08-61 |1.77
|3 |'Clayton' |'Adam' |&nbsp; |03-13-60 |1.78
|4 |'Mullen' |'Larry' |&nbsp; |10-31-61 |1.70
|===

To quickly start using DataBase assertions, follow the steps below.

== Add the assertj-db dependency to your project

=== Maven

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
  <artifactId>assertj-db</artifactId>
  <version>{page-component-version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle

For Gradle users (using the Maven Central Repository)

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
testImplementation("org.assertj:assertj-db:{page-component-version}")
----

=== Other dependency management tool

Check this page to find the relevant http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|org.assertj|assertj-db|{page-component-version}|bundle[assertj db dependency declaration].

== Statically import org.assertj.db.api.Assertions.assertThat

\... and use your preferred IDE code completion after assertThat.

Example from {assertj-examples-repo}/blob/main/assertions-examples/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples/db/TableAssertionExamples.java[TableAssertionExamples.java] :

[source,java]
----
include::example$TableAssertionExamples.java[tags=user_guide]
----

In this simple example you can see many xref:concepts/index.adoc[concepts of AssertJ-DB] (the concepts are simple, but I advise you to take the time to get to know them well) :

* xref::concepts/elements.adoc[The elements] :
** xref::concepts/elements.adoc#table[Table] which represents a table in the database
** xref::concepts/elements.adoc#column[Column] which represents a column of the table
** xref::concepts/elements.adoc#row[Row] which represents a row of the table
** xref::concepts/elements.adoc#value[Value] which represents a value in a column or in a row
* xref::concepts/navigation.adoc#tableorrequestasroot[The navigation] :
** The first check, navigates from the table to the column called "name"
(``column("name")`` moves the assertion to the column),
from this column to the first value (the first call of ``value()`` moves to the first value)
and after that to each value (each call of ``value()`` moves to the next value of the column).
** The second check, navigates from the table to the row with index 1
(``row(1)`` moves the assertion to the row),
from this row to the first value
and after that to each value (``value()`` calls have similar behavior for rows and columns).
* xref::concepts/datetime.adoc[DateValue] : The preferred way to compare values with date, time and date/time is to use java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalTime, java.time.LocalDateTime.
But for the backward compatibility, it's always possible to use AssertJ-DB DateValue utilities.
