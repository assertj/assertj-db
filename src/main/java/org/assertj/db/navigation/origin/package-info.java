/**
 * This package contains interfaces that defines the different {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin}s used by the navigation.
 * <p>These {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin}s are the key to help the navigation.<br>
 * The {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin} is used by the {@link org.assertj.db.api.AbstractAssertWithOrigin#returnToOrigin()} method
 * to return to the previous instance that provides assertion methods :
 * for example to return to a object with assertion methods on a table ({@link org.assertj.db.api.TableAssert})
 * from a object with assertion methods on a column ({@link org.assertj.db.api.TableColumnAssert}).<br>
 * As shown in the javadoc of the navigation package, it is possible to navigate to a "smaller" thing (from a column to a value)
 * but also to a "bigger or equivalent" thing (from a column to another column or to a row).
 * The second possibility is possible thank to the {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin} because the classes with {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin}
 * use the navigation methods of their {@link org.assertj.db.navigation.origin.Origin}s.
 * </p>
